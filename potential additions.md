# Potential additions

* Quality of Life changes
    * Summation cells for each column/row
        * With higher grid sizes, it can be really hard to keep track of how many cells need to be filled in a column<br>
        Want to add cells on the opposite site of the board that has the sum of all the numbers together (or maybe numbers + spaces?? idk)
    * Additional sidebar
        * Toggleable timer for charm
            * Like in original game!
        * Perfect charm streak
            * Maybe perfect/complete ratio?
        * Total playtime?
        * THEME CUSTOMISER???????
            * nah that would be too much effort

* Better styling/theming
    * Add spacing between charm pattern labels, like in original Charm Studies
        * Might have problems on larger grids where extra spacing could be disruptive
    * Make crossed out cells have larger cross (as in multiplication sign, Ã—)
        * Basically, resizing text with differing grid cell sizes
    * "You did it!" complete banner on perfect charm
        * Alternative banner for imperfect completion
* Additional gameplay features
    * Custom grid sizing input
    * The original charm gallery, maybe???
        * Could incorporate charms from original game but I feel like that would be problematic (just go play the original game >-<)
        * Or could make charms myelf
            * Even still how would you even make something like this--
                * I just know how to edit style stuff :/
    * Any possibility for charm editor?????
        * Probably not - finding seeds would take too long
            * Unless custom seeds could be generated (probably not though)
    * Cassia reactions???
        * Again, could be problematic
            * As a fan of Nami's work I want to include this stuff but I don't want to detract or steal from the original >.<
