# Potential additions

* Quality of Life changes
  * THEME CUSTOMISER???????
    * nah that would be too much effort
  * Rework footer to be buttons instead of long text
    * Create button modals to house tutorial, credits, and update log

* Better styling/theming
  * "You did it!" complete banner on perfect charm
    * Alternative banner for imperfect completion
  * Moving away from select elements
    * select2 is a pain
    * Making things more accessible
      * Increasing contrast for sum elements in light mode
* Additional gameplay features
  * Any possibility for charm editor?????
    * Probably not - finding seeds would take too long
      * Unless custom seeds could be generated (probably not though)
  * Cassia reactions???
    * Again, could be problematic
      * As a fan of Nami's work I want to include this stuff but I don't want to detract or steal from the original >.<
  * Integrated tutorial
    * Create lore that Cassia made the website for others to practice charms without needing magic
      * so that others who struggled learning charms can benefit too :3
    * Either separate page or pop-up dialogue
