# Potential additions

* Quality of Life changes
  * THEME CUSTOMISER???????
    * nah that would be too much effort

* Better styling/theming
  * Add spacing between charm pattern labels, like in original Charm Studies
    * Might have problems on larger grids where extra spacing could be disruptive
  * "You did it!" complete banner on perfect charm
    * Alternative banner for imperfect completion
* Additional gameplay features
  * Any possibility for charm editor?????
    * Probably not - finding seeds would take too long
      * Unless custom seeds could be generated (probably not though)
  * Cassia reactions???
    * Again, could be problematic
      * As a fan of Nami's work I want to include this stuff but I don't want to detract or steal from the original >.<
